* BurnMan Solution and ElasticSolution objects are now instantiated
  with a SolutionModel object as a solution_model parameter.
  The use of the solution_type parameter has been removed
  completely, along with all of the optional parameters that were
  originally passed as parameters to SolutionModel.
