* New: BurnMan now has an ElasticSolution class
  that implements the elastic solution proposed in
  :cite:`Myhill2018`. This class defines excess
  thermodynamic properties of solutions relative
  to the properties of the solution endmembers
  at fixed volume and temperature,
  rather than at fixed pressure and temperature.
  Thus, the models are most easily expressed
  through parameterisations of the Helmholtz
  energy, rather than the Gibbs energy.
