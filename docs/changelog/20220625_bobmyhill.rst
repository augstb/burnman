* New: BurnMan now has a function method for
  defining solution/elastic solution models.
  To use this method, the user should provide
  a function for the excess nonconfigurational
  Gibbs/Helmholtz energy during initialisation
  of the model. The ideal entropy is calculated
  internally as for all the other
  solution models.
